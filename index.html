            <p>Hi, I’m Akorfa, a passionate Web Developer with a love 
                for creating clean, functional, and visually engaging websites. 
                I believe great design isn’t just about looks — 
                it’s about building experiences that are simple, creative, and impactful.</p>
            <p>
                Over the years, I’ve honed my skills in [mention a few key tools/skills 
                — e.g., HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, or UI/UX design], working on projects 
                that range from personal portfolios to business websites. My goal is always the same: 
                to help clients bring their ideas to life and achieve growth through thoughtful web solutions.
            </p>
            <p>
                When I’m not coding or designing, you’ll likely find me 
                [insert a personal touch — e.g., exploring new tech trends, 
                sketching ideas, or enjoying a good book with coffee]
